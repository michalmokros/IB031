    "Anomaly detection is the task of finding suspicious data points in the dataset. There are multiple reasons why a data point may be suspicious (see slides of lecture 4). Another similar term to anomaly is outlier and both are very often used interchangeably. Formally, an anomaly is generated by a different mechanism than the rest of the data whereas an outlier is generated by the same mechanisms but is just far away from the rest of the data. Nevertheless, in any practical usecase, there is just no way of distinguishing between the two and we will use these terms interchangeably as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomalies are not necessarily a bad thing. They are just data points that do not follow typical pattern in the data. They can be actually very interesting. They can, for example, indicate a problem in your experiment design, a fraud in the stream of money transactions, or a new scientific discovery waiting to be understood. In either case, its worth spending some time investigating them instead of just throwing them away immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main use cases for anomaly detection.\n",
    "1. Detecting outliers in the data as a part of preprocessing and data cleaning. In this case the outliers are often discarded from the training data so the model learns only the main data generating mechanisms.\n",
    "2. Detecting anomalies as a standalone machine learning task. In this case we are especially interested in anything suspicious and it is out main interest, e.g., detecting frauds in cyber security. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will look at both use cases. As always, you can read a bit more about outlier detection in [scikit-learn user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html#)."
