    "Baseline is a general term for any threshold that we aim to beat with our machine learning model. It is often 1) result obtained using simple label/target distribution statistic or 2) previously obtained results. Case 1) is common when you are tackling a new problem for the first time and you have no idea how any machine learning model will perform. Case 2) is common for improving on previous results, e.g., results published in literature. Note that in case 2) the baseline can be result of arbitrary complex model even state-of-the-art neural network. The baseline is not always easy to beat.\n",
